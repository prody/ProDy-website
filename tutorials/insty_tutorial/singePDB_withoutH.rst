PDB structure without hydrogens
===============================================================================

Very often, PDB structures downloaded directly from the PDB database will not
have determined hydrogen atoms that are required, for example, for predicting
hydrogen bonds. In such a case, we can use the :func:`.addHydrogens` function.
It will allow us to use one of two available methods (``openbabel`` or ``pdbfixer``)
to predict the position of hydrogen atoms in protein structure.

To use one of those functions, we need to install additional Python package(s).
For Anaconda_ users, the installation will be the following:

Installation of Openbabel_:

.. parsed-literal::

   conda install -c conda-forge openbabel   

Installation of PDBfixer_:

.. parsed-literal::

   conda install -c conda-forge pdbfixer


Add missing hydrogen atoms to the structure
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We start by fetching the PDB file with **5KQM** code (:file:`5kqm.pdb`).
Openbabel_ requires having the PDB file in the same folder. Therefore, it
needs to be downloaded and saved to successfully perform the operation with
adding missing hydrogens. A new file will be saved with the same name with
the additional prefix ``addH_``.

.. ipython:: python

   from prody import *
   from pylab import *
   import matplotlib
   ion()   # turn interactive mode on

Openbabel_ or PDBfixer_ require PDB file saved in the direcory. Therefore
first it needs to be downloaded.

.. ipython:: python
   :verbatim:

   fetchPDB('5kqm', compressed=False)

.. parsed-literal::

   @> Connecting wwPDB FTP server RCSB PDB (USA).
   @> Downloading PDB files via FTP failed, trying HTTP.
   @> 5kqm downloaded (5kqm.pdb)
   @> PDB download via HTTP completed (1 downloaded, 0 failed).


When PDB file is already in the local directory, we can choose between
Openbabel_ and PDBfixer_ to add missing hydrogen bonds to the protein
structure:

Openbabel:

.. ipython:: python
   :verbatim:

   PDBname = '5kqm.pdb'
   addMissingAtoms(PDBname, method='openbabel')

.. parsed-literal::

   @> Hydrogens were added to the structure. Structure addH_5kqm.pdb is saved in the local directry.

PDBfixer:

.. ipython:: python
   :verbatim:

   addMissingAtoms(PDBname, method='pdbfixer')

.. parsed-literal::

   @> Hydrogens were added to the structure. New structure is saved as addH_5kqm.pdb.

Next, we can parse the saved structure with hydrogen atoms to ProDy and analyze
it in the same way as in the previous paragraph.

.. ipython:: python
   :verbatim:

   atoms = parsePDB('addH_'+str(PDBname)).select('protein')

.. parsed-literal::

   @> 2800 atoms and 1 coordinate set(s) were parsed in 0.03s.
