Signature Interactions of ensembles
===============================================================================

We have developed a pipeline that leverages BLAST, Dali, or Foldseek search to
identify and download homologs for a particular PDB structure. The
identified structures are prepared for InSty analysis by applying the following
steps: (i) download PDB, (ii) extract particular chains, (iii) add
hydrogens/side chains, (iv) perform structural alignment, (v) create a
folder with prepared structures in it.

As an example, we will use Aurora kinase A structure (PDB code: **1OL5**).



BLAST approach
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will use the PDB code and chain ID to access information from the BLAST server.
Additionally, we can also define many different types of parameters. Here, we
will define sequence identity (``seqid``) and the method to add missing hydrogen bonds
and side chains (``fixer``; it can be PDBFixer or Openbabel). We can also define a name for
a folder in which all the downloaded files will be uploaded (``folder_name``). 

To download homologs, add missing hydrogens and align structures, we will
use the :func:`.runBLAST` function:


.. ipython:: python
   :verbatim:

   PDBcode = '1ol5'
   runBLAST(PDBcode, 'A', seqid=70, fixer='openbabel', folder_name='struc_homologs_BLAST')

To compute all types of interactions for each homolog, we use the
:func:`.calcSignatureInteractions` function, and we are providing the name of the
folder with the structures.

This function will create additional files with the prefix ``'INT_'+type_of_interactions``
for each file. In such a file besides the protein structure,
we will have dummy atoms that will correspond to the interactions. 
The dummy atoms will be inserted exactly between the residue-residue pair which
is interacting. We are computing seven types of non-covalent interactions 
(hydrogen bonds - ``HBs``, salt bridges - ``SBs``, repulsive ionic bonding -
``RIB``, pi-cation - ``PiCat``, pi-stacking - ``PiStack``, hydrophobic interactions -
``HPh``, and disulfide bonds - ``DiBs``).

Now, we need to go to the newly created folder ``struc_homologs_BLAST`` and use
:func:`.findClusterCenters` for each type of interactions to detect clusters
of interactions. We cannot do it in an automatic way because each system is
different and often default parameters of ``numC`` and ``distC`` should be tuned.

To compute fingerprint interactions of hydrogen bonds, use the command below.
This function uses the prefix ``INT_HBs_`` to select analyzed interactions. 
Originally, :func:`.findClusterCenters` was created to analyze water clusters
with the WatFinder module. To apply it here, we are changing the ``selection``
to ``resnume DUM`` given to dummy atoms that represent interactions.

We can further visualize those results in a graphical program like VMD_.
The obtained results are with default ``numC`` and ``distC`` parameters, and it means
that we were identifying interactions that were within 0.3 Ang. from each other 
(``distC``) in at least three structures (``numC``). To see more information about those 
parameters, see the `WatFinder tutorial`_.

Dali approach
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can use a similar approach with the PDB list provided by the Dali server
instead of BLAST. This time, to download homologs, add missing hydrogens, and
align structures, we will use :func:`.runDali` function. 

For the ``subset_Dali`` parameter, we will use ``PDB25`` instead of the full 
list of homologs, which is the default. 

We will use Openbabel to fix the structure and all prepared structures will
be copied to a folder with ``folder_name`` set to ``struc_homologs_Dali``.


.. ipython:: python
   :verbatim:

   runDali(PDBcode, 'A', fixer='openbabel', subset_Dali='PDB25',

Foldseek approach
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Foldseek requires additional installation of Foldseek and the PDB database
download. See more details on the Foldseek_ website. Once the installation of
Foldseek and downloading database to ``~/Downloads/foldseek`` folder is done,
we can run :func:`.runFoldseek` function. Foldseek requires a PDB file in the
local directory. Therefore, first, we will fetch it.


.. ipython:: python
   :verbatim:

   fetchPDB(PDBcode, compressed=False)

.. parsed-literal::

   @> Connecting wwPDB FTP server RCSB PDB (USA).
   @> Downloading PDB files via FTP failed, trying HTTP.
   @> 1ol5 downloaded (1ol5.pdb)
   @> PDB download via HTTP completed (1 downloaded, 0 failed).


Now, we will run Foldseek, but with more restricted parameters by applying
higher values for ``coverage_threshold`` and ``tm_threshold``. Default
criteria is providing large number of PDB files for analysis (~4000 files
for PDB code *1OL5*). 


.. ipython:: python
   :verbatim:

   runFoldseek('1ol5.pdb', 'A', coverage_threshold=0.9, tm_threshold=0.9, 
		database_folder='~/Downloads/foldseek/pdb')

.. parsed-literal::

Once the folder with PDB files will be created, we can analyze it with 
:func:`.calcSignatureInteractions` and :func:`.findClusterCenters`. Foldseek
along with the folder containing PDB files, also generates an ``MSA`` file that can
be used to obtain sequentially conserved pairs of residues that are
corresponding to the interacation types. Therefore, we can analyze only the folder
or the folder with the MSA file by giving ``mapping_file``. Both cases are shown
below. Using the MSA allows us to compare interactions between corresponding residues
rather than just comparing in 3D space as above.

Analysis of the folder with prepared PDB homologs:

Once the calculations are completed and files with the prefix ``'INT_'``
are generated, we can look at the clusters for each type of interaction.  
When we are providing an MSA file for analysis, besides ``INT_*.pdb`` files,
several additional files are generated, such as consensus ``txt`` files with
pairs of residues that are participating in each type of interactions and
their count/percentage of occurence among the homolog structures.  

For this example, we obtained six consensus files: ``HBs_consensus.txt``,
``SBs_consensus.txt``, ``RIB_consensus.txt``, ``PiStack_consensus.txt``,
``PiCat_consensus.txt``, ``HPh_consensus.txt``. Disulfide bonds are not
present in the protein structure.

The file ``HBs_consensus.txt`` content is as follows:

This content is also displayed on the plot in ``PNG`` format that is saved
in the folder. If there are a lot of results, several plots will be created,
as exemplified by hydrogen bonds for which we identified 61 pairs of
residues.

Further, to compute the fingerprint interactions, use the corresponding
prefix. For hydrogen bonds is ``INT_HBs_``:

.. ipython:: python
   :verbatim:

   findClusterCenters('INT_HBs_*.pdb', selection = 'resname DUM')

.. parsed-literal::

   @> 4338 atoms and 1 coordinate set(s) were parsed in 0.12s.

If we compare BLAST and Foldseek results, we can see that, in this case,
BLAST detected more conserved interactions. However, the results for
Foldseek or Dali would look differently if we used a full database with
default parameters. 
It is important, however, to know that some of the methods might be better
than others, and all depends on the protein we are choosing, their sequence
identity, and 3D structure similarity toward homologs.
